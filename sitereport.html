            <h2>Development Experience</h2>
            <p>Learning web programming has been a tough but rewarding experience.</p>

            <div class="toggle-content">
                <p>I started with easy HTML tutorials and subsequently moved on to more advanced topics like CSS. W3school and other internet tools helped me establish a solid foundation for my work. Understanding responsive design concepts required extensive practice and experimenting. During this time, I learned how to develop visually beautiful websites with high functionality. However, as I understood CSS Flexbox and Grid layout styles, I was able to create sleeker layouts without much effort. As a result of this experience, I have valuable abilities for future web design positions.</p>

            <p>My Web Development class was very eye-opening.</p>

            <div class="toggle-content">
                <p>I made design decisions solely on the basis of user friendliness and accessibility. In this case, the arrangement I went with is tidy, modern, and has colours that enhance the readability of the text. The development method consisted of meticulous planning, step-by-step coding, and rigorous testing. This lesson helped me develop my technical skills and encouraged me to think logically and solve problems. I learned the value of perseverance and patient development in web design when I reflect on that journey. This divergence from this discourse will surely function as a guide for my future endeavours.</p>

            <div class="toggle-content">
                <p> For web pages to be of high quality and well-performing, it is necessary to validate HTML and CSS code. I checked my code using W3C Markup Validation Service and CSS validator. Some errors were disclosed during the validation process; for example, some alt attributes were missing, or else wrong CSS syntax was used. These problems contributed towards enhancing overall code quality as well as compliance with web standards. The validation reports made clear where improvement was needed. The procedure has been illustrated by providing screenshots of the validation results. At last, user experience and accessibility have been accomplished through checking codes thereby making best practices in web development imperative.</p>

            <p>The website employs the 'Poppins' font for a clean, modern look and uses global styles to ensure consistency across browsers. The fixed navigation bar features hover effects for a dynamic user experience. The flex layout adapts to various screen sizes, with distinct background gradients enhancing visual separation. Icons have hover effects for visual feedback, and content styling highlights key information. Circular elements with images and shadows add depth. Media queries ensure responsiveness, with a hamburger menu for mobile navigation. The projects and contact sections use CSS Grid and Flexbox for a polished appearance, and the site report includes expandable content and an image gallery for validation.</p>

Creating a screenplay was an important step in preparing the information for delivery so that I could convey it without ambiguity. After that, I recorded and edited the final version before making it available online. This video can be accessed at [Video URL]. The demo not only exhibits how the project works, but also my ability to deliver technical knowledge in a presentational manner. Video demonstrations are an interactive approach for potential clients, business partners, or employers to see what I can achieve in this industry.</p>
